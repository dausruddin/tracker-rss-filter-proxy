I am in the mood of building my ratio in private trackers.
But one problems is there is no simple way to filter by size.

So I made this proxy that will filter the content by size.

#Usage:
1. Rename `config.py.example` to `config.py`, and edit.
   There are 2 entries for example, IPTorrents and Aither.
2. Start `main.py`
3. Visit the URL - `http://localhost:8080/rss?source=aither&key=test`
